      One of the first decentralized exchange traders was RenGenX founder M. J. Dillon. When early versions of decentralized trading
      began to appear in 2016, he began to work closely with the founder of EtherDelta to improve that platform. Along with
      RenGenX team member Tim Haberham, Dillon was instrumental in helping to engage and support hundreds of the earliest
      decentralized exchange traders and developers.
    </div>
    <div class="rgx-justified-text shouldAnimate animation-delay-1">
      RenGenX today is already a functional technology available for beta testing on the Ethereum network. Powered by possibly
      one of the most advanced smart contracts ever deployed on the Ethereum network, this feature-rich, compliance-focused
      smart contract expects to allow peer-to-peer leverage, the creation and trading of options on tokens, and directed
      trading between individual users. In addition to a number of advanced customer support features, RenGenX will sport
      a reactive and clear user interface, and a backend order book system that intends to prevent fat-finger errors and
      eliminates the possibility of front-running directed trades.
    </div>
    <div class="rgx-justified-text shouldAnimate animation-delay-2">
      The intended flexible and upgradeable compliance functionality would allow restricted tokens to trade under custom conditions.
      With RenGenX’s anticipated trade-level, smart contract based, compliance engine, this exchange would provide a decentralized
      marketplace for restricted tokens that could potentially adapt to future changes to the international regulatory environment
      as they happen.
    </div>
    <div class="rgx-justified-text shouldAnimate animation-delay-3">
      RenGenX’s vision is to evolve their existing Ethereum-based decentralized exchange into a multitude of decentralized exchanges
      powered by other blockchains (such as EOS and Neo) along with institutional grade position management tools and custom
      reporting (P&amp;L, historical positions, tax reporting) utilizing their custom multi-chain block explorer.

        RenGenX anticipates meeting the expected overwhelming need for a equity token exchange. Tokenized securities have potential
        to be the future of investment in early-stage startups, and these professional investors should demand institutional
        grade tools and desire a single platform to manage assets on a variety of blockchain networks.
      </b>
    </div>
    <div class="rgx-justified-text shouldAnimate animation-delay-1">
      RenGenX’s expected advanced compliance engine would enable this exchange to provide a decentralized marketplace for restricted
      tokens and adapt to changes in securities classifications and regulations. By working with our AML/KYC partners, we
      expect to be able to support institutional investors across the globe.
    </div>
    <div class="rgx-justified-text shouldAnimate animation-delay-2">
      Decentralized exchanges are likely an elegant solution to many of the security and custody issues that centralized exchanges
      may face by potentially empowering professional investors to maintain custody and implement their own cybersecurity
      protocols. RenGenX’s goal is to become the premier regulated token exchange.
